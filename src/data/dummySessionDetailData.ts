### Purpose

The LLM Playground is designed for you to test, iterate, and compare different prompts and models. It's a great space to enhance your understanding and effectiveness in working with Large Language Models (LLMs).

### Security

Additionally, security is a top priority for us, which is why we conduct tests with independent, third-party security experts. Their goals include:

- Identifying potential security vulnerabilities in our infrastructure and application.
- Simulating real-world attack scenarios to understand our defenses.
- Validating the effectiveness of existing security controls.
- Ensuring ongoing resilience against emerging threats.
